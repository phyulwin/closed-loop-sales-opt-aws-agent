## Deployment / GitHub Pages

This repository contains a simple static site consisting of `index.html`, `server.js`, `simulation.js`, and `src/styles.css`.

To have GitHub Pages serve the repository root (so `index.html` in the repo root is used), go to your repository's Settings → Pages and set the source to `main` branch and folder `/ (root)`.

To preview locally, you can run the included server:

```powershell
npm install
node server.js
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
