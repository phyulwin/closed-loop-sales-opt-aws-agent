To suggest a new price or bundling strategy to improve profit, we'll need to consider a few factors and make some assumptions. Without more information about costs, price elasticity, or customer behavior, I'll provide some general strategies that could potentially improve profits:

1. Price adjustment:
   - Try a small price increase: Raise the price to $29.99. This might not significantly impact sales volume but could increase profit per unit.
   - Or test a price decrease: Lower the price to $24.99 to potentially increase sales volume and overall profit.

2. Bundling strategies:
   a) Complementary product bundle:
      - Offer a bundle of the main product with a complementary item at a slight discount.
      - Example: Main product ($28) + Complementary item ($12) = Bundle price of $38 (saves customer $2)

   b) Volume discount:
      - Offer a discount for purchasing multiple units.
      - Example: Buy 2 for $52 (saves $4) or Buy 3 for $75 (saves $9)

   c) Mix and match bundle:
      - If you have multiple product variations, offer a discount for purchasing different types together.
      - Example: Any 2 different variations for $50

3. Tiered pricing:
   - Introduce different versions of the product at various price points.
   - Example: Basic version ($24.99), Standard version ($28), Premium version ($34.99)

4. Limited time offers:
   - Create urgency with time-limited discounts or bundles.
   - Example: "This week only: Buy one at $28, get 50% off the second unit"

5. Loyalty program:
   - Implement a points system or membership program that offers discounts or exclusive bundles to repeat customers.

To determine the most effective strategy, it's crucial to:
1. Analyze your costs and profit margins
2. Understand your target market and their price sensitivity
3. Test different strategies and monitor their impact on sales and overall profit
4. Gather customer feedback on pricing and bundling options

Remember, the goal is to find the sweet spot that maximizes total profit, not necessarily just increasing the price or sales volume individually.
